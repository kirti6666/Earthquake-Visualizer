Earthquake Visualizer  

Overview  
The Earthquake Visualizer is a web application that displays recent earthquake data on an interactive map.  
It fetches real-time earthquake information from the USGS Earthquake API and provides users with a clear, visual way to explore earthquake activity worldwide.  

Tech Stack  
- Framework:React  
- Styling:Tailwind CSS  
- State Management: React Hooks & Context API  
- Data Source:[USGS Earthquake API] (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)  
- Deployment: CodeSandbox / StackBlitz / Vercel  

Installation & Setup

Features:
1.Fetches real-time earthquake data from the USGS API.
2.Displays earthquakes on an interactive map with markers.
3.Marker size & color indicate earthquake magnitude.
4.Clickable markers show earthquake details (location, time, magnitude, depth).
5.Responsive design for desktop and mobile users.

Approach & Notes:
1.Data is fetched from the USGS Earthquake API (public, no authentication needed).
2.Used Leaflet.js (via React-Leaflet) for map rendering and interactive markers.
3.Focused on a clean UI with Tailwind CSS.
4.Limited to the most recent earthquake events for performance reasons.

Future Improvements:
1.Add filters (by region, magnitude, or time).
2.Include charts/graphs for earthquake trends.
3.Implement offline mode using cached data.
